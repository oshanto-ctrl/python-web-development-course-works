Assignment 2

You are tasked with creating a python program for a restaurant that
offers different discounts based on the day and time of the week.
Wreite a python script that prompots the user to input the day of the week
and the time(in 24 hour format) they plan to visit the restaurant.
Based on this information, the program should output the applicable discount offer.

The discount offers are as follows:
# On weekdays (Monday to Friday):
Before 5 PM: No discount.
After 5 PM: 10% discount on the total bill amount.

# On weekends (Saturday and Sunday):
Before 3 PM: 5% discount on the total bill amount.
After 3 PM: 7% discount on the total bill amount.

Your program should validate the user input to ensure it corresponds to valid days of the week
and a valid time format. If the input is invalid, the program should
display an appropriate error message and prompt the user to input again.

Your program should use conditional statements to determine the discount offer
based on the user input.

Ensure your code is well documented and follows python best practices.
