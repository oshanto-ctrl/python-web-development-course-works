Prime Factorization

Problem Statement:
Given a positive integer X, find all its prime factors.

Input Format:
A single integer X.

Output Format:
Print all prime factors of X in ascending order, separated by spaces. Each factor must
appear as many times as it divides X.

Example:

Input:
 12

Output:
 2 2 3

Explanation:
โข Prime factors of 12: 12รท2=6, 6รท2=3, and 3 is a prime number.
